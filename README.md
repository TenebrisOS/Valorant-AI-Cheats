# Valorant AI Cheats
- Basically, this project uses AI to give advices to player in real-time around the valorant map, for exemple : When player is attacker and entering a random site, AI will calculate older ennemies positions, movements and level to theorize their positions. The informations will be received by player with either audio tts or third party xray to valorant
- To be honest, i don't think this has to be considered as "cheats" but it has to be forbidden
- *Currently thinking about a way to make that project (don't have)*
